# iris-flower-classification

This repository contains a Python script for performing classification on the famous Iris dataset using machine learning algorithms. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in the field of data science and machine learning, and this code demonstrates how to perform classification tasks on it.


Introduction
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for classification tasks. This code demonstrates how to load the Iris dataset, perform data preprocessing, and build and evaluate machine learning models for classification.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any machine learning project. In this code, we load the Iris dataset from a CSV file and perform the following data preprocessing tasks:

Dropping unnecessary columns
Handling missing values (if any)
Splitting the data into training and testing sets
Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is essential for understanding the dataset's characteristics and relationships. In this code, we visualize the data using various plots, including box plots and histograms. We also use seaborn to create a pair plot to visualize the relationships between different features, colored by the species of iris.

Model Building
We use several machine learning algorithms to build classification models, including:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
The code trains these models on the training data and evaluates their performance on the testing data. We calculate and print accuracy scores and create confusion matrices to assess each model's performance.

Results
The code presents the results of the classification models in a tabular format. The results include the model name and its accuracy score. The table is sorted in descending order of accuracy.
